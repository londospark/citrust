# Session Log: 2026-02-22T01:41:00Z — GitHub Setup

**Session ID:** 2026-02-22T014100Z-github-setup  
**Facilitator:** Samus (Architect)  
**Participants:** Samus, team roster (Link, Toad, Fox)  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  

---

## Objective

Establish GitHub project management infrastructure for the citrust 4-phase Rust port of b3DSDecrypt.py. Enable parallel team coordination across phases and modules.

## Decisions Made

### 1. Repository Setup
- **Name:** londospark/citrust
- **Visibility:** Public
- **Description:** Rust port of b3DSDecrypt.py with phases: (1) Basic working version, (2) SIMD optimization, (3) Multi-threading, (4) SteamOS GUI + packaging

### 2. Label System (20 total)
Three-axis taxonomy for filtering and assignment:
- **phase:phase-1, phase:phase-2, phase:phase-3, phase:phase-4** (4 labels)
- **module:keys, module:crypto, module:ncsd, module:ncch, module:decrypt, module:cli, module:gui** (7 labels)
- **type:feature, type:refactor, type:test, type:infra** (4 labels)
- **squad:link, squad:toad, squad:fox, squad:samus** (5 labels)

### 3. Issue Structure (21 issues)
One issue per module per phase, plus cross-cutting infrastructure:
- **Phase 1 (Core Implementation):** #1-#6 (modules) + #7-#9 (testing) = 9 issues
- **Phase 2 (SIMD):** #10-#11 (optimization) + #12 (regression testing) = 3 issues
- **Phase 3 (Threading):** #13-#15 (parallelism) + #16 (regression testing) = 4 issues
- **Phase 4 (GUI & Packaging):** #17 (workspace), #18-#19 (GUI), #20 (packaging) = 4 issues
- **Infrastructure:** #21 (CI workflow) = 1 issue

Each issue includes:
- Acceptance criteria
- Dependencies (cross-references to blocking/blocked-by issues)
- Owner assignment (via squad:* label)
- Phase and module tags

### 4. Milestones (4 total)
One milestone per phase with deliverable definition:
- **Phase 1 Milestone:** Working CLI decryption, unit + integration tests, benchmark vs Python
- **Phase 2 Milestone:** AES-NI enabled, optimized chunk sizes, regression tests, Phase 1 vs Phase 2 benchmark
- **Phase 3 Milestone:** Parallel I/O + chunk/section-level RomFS parallelism, regression tests, Phase 2 vs Phase 3 benchmark
- **Phase 4 Milestone:** Workspace conversion, GUI with gamepad support, AppImage packaging, CI workflow

Issue #21 (CI) left unassigned to a milestone since it spans all phases.

### 5. Project Board
- **Name:** "citrust Roadmap"
- **Type:** GitHub Projects v2 (modern, supports custom fields)
- **Columns:** Todo, In Progress, Done (GitHub Projects v2 defaults)
- **Issues:** All 21 issues added to board
- **Automation:** None configured (manual workflow, small team)

### 6. Agent Assignment
Clear ownership for parallel work:
- **Link (Core Dev):** #1-#6 (Phase 1 modules), #10-#11 (Phase 2 SIMD), #13-#15 (Phase 3 threading)
- **Toad (Tester):** #7-#9 (Phase 1 testing), #12 (Phase 2 regression), #16 (Phase 3 regression)
- **Fox (GUI Dev):** #18-#19 (Phase 4 GUI + gamepad)
- **Samus (Lead):** #17 (workspace conversion), #20 (AppImage packaging), #21 (CI workflow)

## Architecture Context (From Concurrent Decisions)

The following architectural decisions informed the GitHub structure:

1. **Port Architecture:** Single crate (Phases 1–3) → workspace (Phase 4)
2. **Crypto:** RustCrypto (`aes` + `ctr`) for AES-128-CTR
3. **Testing:** Hybrid approach — re-encrypted ROM fixtures + synthetic minimal fixtures
4. **Packaging:** Static musl CLI binary + AppImage for GUI
5. **GUI Framework:** egui/eframe (immediate-mode, gamepad-friendly)
6. **Progress Reporting:** Callback-based API (CLI uses `indicatif`, GUI uses egui widgets)

## Team Roster Confirmed

| Name | Role | Focus | GitHub Handle |
|------|------|-------|---|
| Samus | Architect/Lead | Infrastructure, workspace, packaging, CI | londospark |
| Link | Core Developer | Core modules, SIMD, threading | — |
| Toad | Tester | Unit tests, integration tests, benchmarks, regression | — |
| Fox | GUI Developer | GUI framework, gamepad integration, SteamOS UX | — |

## Decisions Documented for Team Memory

The following decision documents were written and stored in `.squad/decisions.md`:
1. Copilot directive (implementation phases)
2. GUI framework recommendation (egui/eframe)
3. Crypto crate selection (aes + ctr)
4. GitHub project management structure
5. Port architecture (single crate → workspace)
6. Test strategy (hybrid fixture approach)

## Artifacts

✅ GitHub repository (londospark/citrust)  
✅ 20 labels + taxonomy documentation  
✅ 21 issues with acceptance criteria + dependencies  
✅ 4 milestones with deliverable definitions  
✅ Project board "citrust Roadmap"  
✅ Issue-to-agent mapping documented  

## Success Criteria

✅ Repository created and public  
✅ Labels cover all three axes (phase, module, type, squad)  
✅ Issues are granular enough for parallel work  
✅ Each issue has clear acceptance criteria  
✅ Dependencies are documented (cross-references)  
✅ Team roster is confirmed (4 agents)  
✅ Each agent has clear ownership of issues  
✅ Project board is set up and populated  

## Next Actions (Outside GitHub Setup Scope)

1. **Coordinator:** Verify test ROM encryption status, confirm .gitignore is correct
2. **Scribe:** Log this session, merge decision inbox, commit team state
3. **Link:** Begin Phase 1 module implementation (issues #1-#6)
4. **Toad:** Prepare test infrastructure and benchmark harness (issues #7-#9)
5. **Fox:** Build GUI prototype with egui (issues #18-#19)
6. **Samus:** Review architectural decisions with team before Phase 1 begins

## Session Notes

- GitHub Projects v2 was chosen for its modern interface and ability to track custom fields (important for future workflow automation)
- Issues were not created in a granular way (one-per-function) to avoid GitHub issue overhead; scope matches "completed by one agent in 1–2 weeks"
- Milestones correspond to phases, not calendar dates (iterations will be time-boxed during active development)
- CI workflow (issue #21) is last in priority but important for quality gate
