# Session: 2026-02-22 Phase 2 Completion
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-22T014204Z  
**Session Type:** Squad Batch Completion  
**Participants:** Toad (Tester), Link (Core Dev), Fox (GUI Dev), Samus (Lead)

## Summary
Completed Phase 2 optimization (SIMD/AES-NI), Phase 4 GUI implementation (egui), and GitHub Actions CI/release automation. All four agents achieved success outcomes.

## Outcomes
- **Toad:** 19 unit tests + criterion benchmarks + compare.ps1 (Phase 1)
- **Link:** 1.50x speedup via AES-NI + 4MB chunk tuning (Phase 2)
- **Fox:** Full egui GUI with file picker, progress, done screens; gamepad-friendly 1280x800 (Phase 4)
- **Samus:** ci.yml (check/test/clippy/fmt) + release.yml (Linux+Windows binaries on tag) (Cross-phase)

## Team Progress
- **Phase 1:** Complete (5 core modules + 19 tests + benchmarks)
- **Phase 2:** Complete (AES-NI + chunk tuning, 1.50x speedup)
- **Phase 3:** Pending (multi-threading with rayon, expected 2–4x additional speedup)
- **Phase 4:** GUI complete, pending Phase 4 integration (workspace split #17)
- **Infra:** CI/release automation complete

## Decision Log
- Merged 4 inbox decisions into main decisions.md
- No duplicates found
- All decisions tagged with timestamp and agent

## Notes
- Link's final speedup noted as 2.39x in manifest (includes prior Phase 1 optimizations)
- Fox's GUI binaries verified: CLI 1.6 MB, GUI 9.2 MB
- Samus's workflows ready for first version tag
- All agents documented learnings in history.md files

## Next Steps
1. Phase 3: Multi-threading with rayon (Link)
2. Phase 4: Workspace split (Samus #17), AppImage packaging (Samus #20)
3. UX testing: GUI manual validation on real ROM (Fox + Toad)
