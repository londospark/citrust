# Orchestration Log: 2026-02-22T01:41:00Z — Samus (GitHub Setup)

**Agent:** Samus (Architect/Lead)  
**Session:** GitHub project management infrastructure setup  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  

---

## Summary

Samus completed full GitHub project management infrastructure for londospark/citrust repository:
- Created repository with 20 labels across three axes (phase, module, type, squad)
- Defined 21 issues covering all phases and modules with detailed acceptance criteria
- Created 4 milestones (one per phase) with clear deliverable definitions
- Set up GitHub Projects v2 board ("citrust Roadmap") with all issues
- Assigned issues to team agents (Link, Toad, Fox, Samus)

## Deliverables

✅ **Repository:** londospark/citrust (public)  
✅ **Labels:** 20 total — phase:* (4), module:* (7), type:* (4), squad:* labels  
✅ **Issues:** 21 total (#1-#21)
  - Phase 1: #1-#9 (core modules + testing)
  - Phase 2: #10-#12 (SIMD optimization)
  - Phase 3: #13-#16 (threading optimization)
  - Phase 4: #17-#20 (workspace conversion + GUI + packaging)
  - Infrastructure: #21 (CI workflow)

✅ **Milestones:** 4 (Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, Phase 4)  
✅ **Project Board:** "citrust Roadmap" (project #6)  
✅ **Agent Assignment:**
- Link: Core development (#1-#6, #10-#11, #13-#15)
- Toad: Testing & benchmarking (#7-#9, #12, #16)
- Fox: GUI development (#18-#19)
- Samus: Infrastructure (#17, #20, #21)

## Key Decisions Documented

1. **Label Taxonomy:** Three-axis system enables filtering by phase, module, and assignee
2. **Issue Granularity:** 21 issues — fine-grained enough for parallel work, coarse enough to avoid overhead
3. **Milestone-per-Phase:** Clear phase boundaries with deliverable definitions
4. **Single Project Board:** Sufficient for small team; uses default GitHub Projects v2 columns
5. **Agent Assignment:** Clear ownership; allows parallel work across phases

## Dependencies & Next Steps

**Blocking:** None — GitHub setup is independent  

**Unblocks:**
- Link can begin Phase 1 implementation (issues #1-#6)
- Toad can prepare test infrastructure (issues #7-#9)
- Fox can prototype GUI (issues #18-#19)

**Handoff:** Architecture decisions (port structure, crypto, testing strategy) must be reviewed by Samus before phase 1 work begins.

## Notes

- Repository is public (londospark/citrust)
- All 21 issues tagged with appropriate phase, module, and type labels
- Project board uses GitHub Projects v2 (modern, supports custom fields)
- Team roster is stable (Link, Toad, Fox, Samus)
- No breaking changes to existing tooling or workflows

**Session End:** 2026-02-22T01:41:00Z  
**Duration:** ~1 hour (GitHub setup complete)  
**Next Agent:** Coordinator (verify .gitignore, test ROM encryption status)
